My infectious disease modelling coursework at Imperial College 2021-2022 MPH Cohort. 
(Course leader: Nim Pathy, one of the best teachers in imparting knowledge I have ever met)

Modelling is an important tool in epidemiology to inform and influence health policy. I don't want I can't recall it when it comes to use this one day. 

Project description:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of death due to infectious disease, and has a complex natural history. A defining feature of the disease is its latent stage of infection, where individuals carry the bacteria in their lungs, but its replication is contained by the immune system. As a result, latent infection carries no excess mortality, nor is it infectious. However, a small proportion of people develop active TB, which does cause death and can be transmitted to other people. There is currently no vaccine against TB, although most cases are curable with 6 months of anti-TB treatment. 

Consider a population without treatment, and with the data given below. What is the endemic prevalence of the disease? How rapidly will cases need to be put on treatment, and cured, in order to bring this prevalence down by 50% over 15 years?

- Some data about the disease, typical of Southeast Asia:
-	On average, each person infects roughly 8 people on average, per year
-	Untreated TB has a 50% case fatality rate, with the remainder recovering on their own. Death or recovery takes 3 years on average, in the absence of treatment.
-	Upon infection, around 5% of people develop active TB, while the other 95% develop latent infection. Of the latter, 5% will go on to develop active TB during their lifetimes.
